<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Galit, and I was born in Karmiel. 
  <br> My parents immigrated to Israel from Uruguay in 1987 with my sister, who was 7 years old at the time.</br>
  After high school, I enlisted in the army and served in a regional brigade in northern Israel. <br>Upon completing my military service, I worked and saved money for the “big trip.” Together with my partner, I traveled through South America, visiting countries such as Argentina, Chile, Peru, and Colombia. We did breathtaking treks and fell in love with the endless beauty of nature that the continent has to offer.
  When I returned to Israel, I began studying a fitness instructor course at the Wingate Institute.</br> I successfully completed the program and decided to pursue a degree in Food Science at Tel-Hai College. I studied for three years and graduated with a degree.

<p>About four years ago, I moved to Tel Aviv and started working in food quality control. After a year, I looked for a new job and was offered a temporary six-month QA position (a maternity leave replacement) in the field of medical biology at Johnson & Johnson. At first, I was hesitant because it wasn’t my field of expertise, and the temporary nature of the position made me think twice. However, I decided to take the chance.
  Six months later, they extended my contract and asked me to stay. After another six months, I received recognition as an outstanding employee. I learned the field independently, fell in love with it, and discovered a lot about myself. 
</p>

<p>Since then, I have transitioned to two more QA positions in different fields (cell therapy), each involving entirely different manufacturing processes.
  The QA field is challenging, as every new role requires me to learn the entire process independently. It demands a deep understanding and a broad perspective to improve processes effectively. QA work requires the ability to zoom in and out, depending on the problem or need at hand.

    And now… I’m ready for my next challenge: become a Full-Stack Web Developer
